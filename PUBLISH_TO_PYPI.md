     - **Owner**: `falatform`
     - **Repository name**: `prompter`
     - **Workflow name**: `publish-to-pypi.yml` (or leave blank for any workflow)
   - Save and copy the "PyPI project" name (should match your package name).

4. **Push your code and workflow to GitHub**
   - Make sure your `pyproject.toml`, code, and `.github/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml` are committed and pushed.

5. **Run the GitHub Action**
